# ARzwolle
# Introduction #
ARZwolle is an augmented reality app made to make citizens in the city Zwolle more aware of the impact that climate change has on them and their city.
## Purpose ##
ARZwolle allows citizens of Zwolle to see what the impact of climate change is and how you can adapt to it. The goal is to let people walk around the city of Zwolle and see what parts of the city are currently being effected by climate change. A map of the city wil show the different QR-codes available upon which objects will be displayed. Each object corresponds to a different climate problem within the city.
## Development ##
this project is made in Xamarin.Forms which gave us the opportunity to deploy this application to multiple platforms. Due to the amount of time we had to develop it, only android is available.[https://www.xamarin.com/](https://www.xamarin.com/)

For the Augmented Reality we used a SDK called Wikitude. Wikitude is an all-in-one reality SDK which combines 3D tracking technology, image recognition, tracking and AR mobile. It uses Javascript for all these features. [http://wikitude.com/](http://wikitude.com/)
